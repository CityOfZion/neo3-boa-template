# Neo3-boa Template

A [Neo3-boa](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo3-boa) project template.

Start by installing the required packages inside `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We 
recommend creating a virtual environment to isolate your Python environment.

## Folder Structure:
```
├── smart_contracts - This folder contains all smart contracts for this template.
│   └── hello_world.py
├── unit_tests - This folder contains a testcase subclassing unittest.TestCase to test the smart contracts.
│   └── test_hello_world.py
├── venv - A venv folder to keep your packages isolated from your base environment.
├── .gitignore - Will ignore Python and Neo3-boa autogenerated files, and IDE folders.
├── default.neo-express - Neo-Express blockchain network instance file.
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt - Contains the name of the python packages needed to compile the smart contract and run the unit tests.
```

## How to use NeoExpress to locally test your smart contract

Install [NeoExpress requirements](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express#requirements) and [NeoExpress](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express#installation).
This repository already has a `.neo-express` file, with two wallets named `admin` and `user`.

Now, you can either test manually by running NeoExpress directly, or you can write a Python script that imports
`NeoTestRunner`. On the `unit_tests` folder, you'll find that the classes that inherit `TestCase` already
come with a `NeoTestRunner` object implemented. Check out the [Neo3-boa documentation](https://neo3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sc/quickstart.html#testing)
for more information on how to invoke methods and assert the results using `NeoTestRunner`.
